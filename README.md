## [Project description]

TTraveloGG is a website for people who loves to travel around the world. Anyone can join the site with a simple username and there is a secret page available only for the site users. TTraveloGG is offering two boards. One is for "travel tips" and the other is for "photos". Each board has "new" button for new posts and posts has "back", "edit", and "delete" buttons. (full CRUD function)
